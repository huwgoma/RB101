    Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!

    The rules of this variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors are as follows:

    Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Lizard,

    Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, Scissors decapitates Lizard,
    
    Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes Rock,
    
    and Rock, as it always has, crushes Scissors.
